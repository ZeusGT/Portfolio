    <h1>About <span>Me</span></h1>
    <h3>Hello! I'm Jonathan.</h3>
    <p>

      I reside in Mavelikara . I'm pursuing bachelor of technology in computer science and engineering in Providence College of Engineering. I have completed my schooling at Mary Immaculate School,Bangalore.

    Some of my strengths are that I am a great listener, self-motivated, and a positive thinker and I strive continually for excellence. My hobbies are listening to music, dancing and travelling as well.
    
    My weakness is I always want to improve myself in better ways than what I'm now. 
    
    My long-term goal is to get a reputed position in the company where I can build my career & help the organization.
